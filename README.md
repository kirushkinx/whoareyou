# Who Are You? (Updated)

Client-side Minecraft mod for Fabric that restores player name tags on servers where they are disabled.

This project is a fork of [ugamii/whoareyou](https://github.com/ugamii/whoareyou). The original mod targeted Minecraft 1.17–1.19.2; this fork updates the codebase for newer Minecraft and Fabric versions and adds some extra quality-of-life tweaks.

## What it does

- Shows your own nickname above your head.
- Shows other player's nicknames on servers that disable it.

## Requirements

- Fabric Loader
- Fabric API
- Mod Menu
- YetAnotherConfigLib (YACL)
